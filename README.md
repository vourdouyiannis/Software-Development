# Software-Development
Refactoring an existing application

The goal of this project is to recognize mistakes that were made when the code was written.
These mistakes appear in certain patterns that I also learned to recognize.
In addition, I understood the point of making a more user-friendly application by exploring the app
and find out what makes the user frustrated when using this application.
So, I fixed every detail that made my life and consequently his life difficult.
The application now is more user-friendly, can be understood and be edited easily by any developer.
